# ansible

On my Github profile you can find few ansible automation scripts for DELL EMC Avamar backup solution. This scripts can help backup admin or people who implement backup solution based on Avamar. 

You can find 4 Ansible roles:

1. install-avamar-windows
2. install-avamar-linux
3. upgrade-avamar-windows
4. upgrade-avamar-linux

Ad. 1,2 Can help you install and register clients to Avamar backup server (windows, linux). Workflow check architecture and choose package to installation.
Ad. 3,4 Can help you upgrade agents on Windows/Linux

Automation this processes can save a lot of time which you can spend on another importent tasks.
